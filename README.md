# Introduction
## The Project
The system allows stores to manage their inventory with the goal of maximising their profit through operational efficiency. It facilitates keeping track of a store's inventory in real-time by allowing users to add new items, update quantities, and view inventory levels in real-time. It will also enable users to generate reports on sales, purchase orders, and other relevant data.
 
## The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year in The ALX Software Engineering Programme. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the development period.

## The Team
* **Faustin Mudemi** (https://github.com/callewise)
* **Muthaura Karimi** (https://github.com/MuthauraCodex)

## Blog posts
After the development phase, we shall write a blog post to inform and reflect on the development of En_Store.

# Architecture
Our web app is a single-page app whose architecture consists of three layers: the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data layer. 

1. The presentation layer is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying information to the user. This layer includes the user interface (UI) components such as forms, tables, charts, and dashboards.

2. The application layer handles the business logic of the system. This layer is responsible for processing user input and generating output based on the rules of the system. The application layer also interacts with the data layer to retrieve and update data.

3. The data layer is responsible for storing and managing the data used by the system. This layer includes the database, which stores all the information about the inventory items, such as their names, descriptions, quantities, and prices.

The diagram below is a simple illustration of how the layers interact within the architecture.
