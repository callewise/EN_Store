# Introduction
## The Project
The system allows stores to manage their inventory with the goal of maximising their profit through operational efficiency. It facilitates keeping track of a store's inventory in real-time by allowing users to add new items, update quantities, and view inventory levels in real-time. It will also enable users to generate reports on sales, purchase orders, and other relevant data.
 
## The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year in The ALX Software Engineering Programme. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the development period.
